# covid_classification
This is a shared repository for the project to build an image classifier distinguishing x-rays of healthy lungs, covid-19 infected lungs and pneumonia infected lungs.

Ideas/Goals:

- write clean code and lay down ground work for future analysis
- compose a useful dataset with an appropriate datastructure
- provide some insight for affected areas of the covid-19 cases (i.e. shap values, GRAD-CAM)
